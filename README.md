This is a toy project called Mist.

This intends to implement an in memory database ( something like redis ), no external library is used here for handling server client connects.

This project works at the socket layer.

The main goal is the get to know how these thing actually work under the hood. The learning that will come as a result is going to be immense and is one of the main attractions for doing this.

It is called Mist because it is intends to say 'Memory IS fasTer' ( makes sense ).
